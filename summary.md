The `describer` project is a Python-based command-line tool that leverages Google's Gemini AI to analyze and document codebases.  It uses `files-to-prompt` to gather all files within a specified directory (respecting .gitignore by default, but with an option to ignore it), then pipes that collected code to the `llm` tool (with the `llm-gemini` plugin) to interact with a specified Gemini model. The AI generates output based on a user-provided prompt, such as an architectural overview, codebase summary, bug identification, or documentation.  The output can be printed to the console or saved to a markdown file. The project is licensed under the MIT license.
